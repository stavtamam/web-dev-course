        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans.
            Celebrations are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash
            Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade
            each day
            (weather permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take
            place the
            last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and
            surrounding communities, including parades and balls (some of them masquerade balls).
            The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade
            schedule and route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest,
            Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding
            large parades and events, such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for naming celebrities as grand
            marshals for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus (similarly known for naming celebrities as their Kings),
            as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a predominantly African American krewe. Float riders
            traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common throws are strings of colorful plastic beads,
            doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys, but throws can also
            include lingerie and more sordid items. Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and route each year.
            While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street and in New Orleans and
            Dauphin, major parades originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles
            Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of the French Quarter. Mardi Gras day traditionally concludes
            with the "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.</p>
