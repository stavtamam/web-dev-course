                            <p>Mardi Gras (/ˈmɑːrdi ˌɡrɑː/), or Fat Tuesday, refers to events of the Carnival
                                celebration, beginning on or after the Christian feasts of the Epiphany (Three Kings
                                Day) and culminating on the day before Ash Wednesday, which is known as Shrove Tuesday.
                                Mardi Gras is French for "Fat Tuesday", reflecting the practice of the last night of
                                eating rich, fatty foods before the ritual Lenten sacrifices and fasting of the Lenten
                                season.

                                Related popular practices are associated with Shrovetide celebrations before the fasting
                                and religious obligations associated with the penitential season of Lent. In countries
                                such as the United Kingdom, Mardi Gras is also known as Shrove Tuesday, which is derived
                                from the word shrive, meaning "to administer the sacrament of confession to; to
                                absolve".

                            <p>The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New
                                Orleans. Celebrations are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove
                                Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian
                                tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many days
                                have several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last
                                five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New
                                Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and balls (some of them
                                masquerade balls).</p>

                            <p>The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans are green, gold, and
                                purple. The colors were first specified in proclamations by the Rex organization during
                                the lead-up to their inaugural parade in 1872, suggesting that balconies be draped in
                                banners of these colors. It is unknown why these specific colors were chosen; some
                                accounts suggest that they were initially selected solely on their aesthetic appeal, as
                                opposed to any true symbolism.[11][12]

                                Errol Laborde, author of Marched the Day God: A History of the Rex Organization,
                                presented a theory that the colors were based on heraldry: all three colors correspond
                                to a heraldic tincture, and Rex's goal may have been to create a tricolor to represent
                                their "kingdom". Purple was widely associated with royalty, while white was already
                                heavily used on other national flags, and was thus avoided. Furthermore, he noted that a
                                flag in green, gold and purple in that order complies with the rule of tincture, which
                                states that metals (gold or silver) can only be placed on or next to other colors, and
                                that colors cannot be placed on or next to other colors.[11]

                                Following a color-themed Rex parade in 1892 that featured purple, green, and
                                gold-colored floats themed around the concepts, the Rex organization retroactively
                                declared that the three colors symbolized justice, power, and faith. The traditional
                                colors are commonly addressed as purple, green, and gold, in that order—even though this
                                order violates the rule of tincture.</p>

                            <p>The method of selecting a king varies from krewe to krewe. Some krewes hold random
                                drawings, while others invite a celebrity guest to be their king. Rex, the King of
                                Carnival, is chosen by the School of Design, who sponsors the Rex parade. His identity
                                is revealed the day before the parade. </p>

                            <p>Mardi Gras parade krewes are private, non-profit organizations whose members get together
                                year round to plan their parade's theme, costumes and unique throws. Each Carnival Club,
                                as they are known, is individually funded by its members. They support their krewe
                                through dues, sales of krewe-related merchandise to their members, and fundraising.
                                Mardi Gras parade krewes sometimes have corporate sponsors.

                                The city of New Orleans is not involved in coordinating Mardi Gras parades; their only
                                involvement is to issue parade permits to each individual Mardi Gras krewe that
                                schedules and coordinates its own parade.</p>

                                in 1995 and continued sharing this with our visitors for several years with companies
                                like Microsoft and REAL Media. The live events showcased on MardiGrasNewOrleans.com have
                                been covered by the New York Times, Chicago Tribune, TImes PIcayune, Morning Advocate,
                                San Diego Union Tribune, Texas Monthly, and the Discovery Channel among others.

                                The first year, we presented the Orpheuscapade, and soon offered live chats with
                                celebrities, interviews with costumed revelers on the streets, and video from atop

                            <p>The tradition of float riders throwing trinkets to the crowds began in the 1870s, and
                                continues today. Typical throws include beads, cups, doubloons and stuffed animals. </p>
